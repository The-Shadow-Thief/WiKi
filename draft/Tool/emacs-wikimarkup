* Basic wikimarkups

<p>
** Heading

<example>
* 	First Level
** 	Second Level
***	Third Level
</example>

** Horizonal Line

<example>
----
</example>

** Emphasis

<example>
*emphasis*
**Strong emphasis**
***very strong emphasis***
_underline test_
=verbatim=
<verbatim>This is used to a large block test</verbatim>
</example>

** Footnotes

<example>
a reference[1],which is just a number in square brackets, constitutes a footnote reference. 
Footnotes:
[1] Footnotes are defined by the same number in brackets
    occurring at the beginning of a line.  Use footnote-mode's C-c
    ! a command, to very easily insert footnotes while typing.  Use
    C-x C-x to return to the point of insertion.

</example>

** Paragraphs
<example>
One or more blank lines separates paragraphs. 
</example>

** Centered paragraphs and quotations
<example>
A line that begins with six or more columns of whitespace (made up of tabs or spaces) indicates a centered paragraph. 
I assume this because it's expected you will use M-s to center the line, which usually adds a lot of whitespace before it.

If a line begins with some whitespace, but less than six columns, it indicates a quoted paragraph. 
</example>

_This dosen't work in my wiki. I will check it._
** Poetic verse

<example> 
Poetry requires that whitespace be preserved, without resorting to the monospace typical of <pre>. 
It likes that it will be printed like input.

You can also use the <verse> tag, if you prefer:

<verse>
       A line of Emacs verse;
       forgive its being so terse.
       
</verse>
</example>

** Literal paragraphs
<example>
Use the HTML tags <pre></pre> to insert a paragraph and preserve whitespace. 
If you're inserting a block of code, you will almost always want to use 
<verbatim></verbatim> *within* the <pre> tags. The shorcut for doing this is to use the example> tag:

       <example>
       Some literal text or code here.
       </example >

</example>

** Table


<example>
       Double bars || Separate header fields
       Single bars | Separate body fields
       Here are more | body fields
       Triple bars ||| Separate footer fields

Other paragraph markup applies to both styles, 
meaning that if six or more columns of whitespace precedes the first line of the table, 
it will be centered, and if any whitespace at all precedes first line, 
it will occur in a blockquote. 
</example>

** Anchors and tagged links

[[emacs-wikimarkup#top][Top]]

<example>
#example If you begin a line with "#anchor" 
-- where anchor can be any word that doesn't contain whitespace 
-- it defines an anchor at that point into the document. This anchor text is not displayed.

You can reference an anchored point in another page (or even in the current page) 
using [[WikiName#anchor][LinkName]]. The #anchor will never be displayed in HTML, 
whether at the point of definition or reference, 
but it will cause browsers to jump to that point in the document. 

[[WikiName#anchor][LinkName]]
WikiName means which page includes anchor.
anchor means anchor defined name.
LinkName means alias which show in reference page.
</example>

** Redirecting to another page or URL
<example>
Sometimes you may wish to redirect someone to another page. To do this, put:

       <redirect url=\"http://somewhereelse.com\"/>

at the top of the page. If the <redirect> tag specifies content, 
this will be used as the redirection message, rather than the default.

The numbers of seconds to delay is defined by `emacs-wiki-redirect-delay', 
which defaults to 2 seconds. The page shown will also contain a link to click on, 
for browsing which do not support automatic refreshing. 
</example>

** URLs
<example>
A regular URL is given as a link. If it's an image URL, it will be inlined using an IMG tag. 
</example>

** Special handling of <nop>WikiNames
<example>
If you need to add a plural at the end of a WikiName, 
separate it with four single quotes (WikiName""s) or make it an explicit link ([[WikiName]]s).

To prevent a link name (of any type) from being treated as such, 
surround it with =equals= (to display it in monotype), 
or prefix it with the tag <nop> to escape it from WikiName markup. 
</example>

** Special Wiki links
<example>
Besides the normal WikiName type links, emacs-wiki also supports extended links:

       [[link text][optional link description]]

An extended link is always a link, no matter how it looks. 
This means you can use any file in your `emacs-wiki-directories' as a Wiki file. 
If you provide an optional description, that's what will be shown instead of the link text. 
This is very useful for providing textual description of URLs.

See the documentation to emacs-wiki-image-regexp for how to inline files and images. 

Example:
[[emacs.html][Return]]
</example>

** <nop>InterWiki names

<example>
There are times when you will want to constantly reference pages on another website. 
Rather than repeating the URL ad nauseum, you can define an InterWiki name. 
This is a set of WikiNames to URL correlations, 
that support textual substitution using #anchor names (which are appended to the URL). 
For example, MeatballWiki is defined in the variable `emacs-wiki-interwiki-names'. 
It means you can reference the page \"MeatBall\" on MeatballWiki using this syntax:

       MeatballWiki#MeatBall

In the resulting HTML, the link is simply shown as

       MeatballWiki:MeatBall

</example>

** Changing Title or Stylesheet 

<example>
For convenience, if you want to change the visible title or the stylesheet 
used by a certain Wiki page during HTML publishing, just put: 
\#title Hello there(del \)
\#style hello.css(del \)
at the top of the page. 
</example>

**  Lists

<example>
Whitespace is required after bullets and numbers thot are part of a list.
Here is an example:

- This
- Is
- A
- List

1. This
2. too

But this is not,
--even if it starts with dashes
0.1] or numbers, as in the original test case.

</example>

*** Sub-lists?
<example>
 - Hello
   <ul>
   <li>There
   <li>My friend
   </ul>
</example>

** Images 
<example>
You can include links of the form `[[some/link][some/image]]'. 
If you want to include alt text, use `[[some/link][some/image alt text]]'.

You may need to have auto-image-file-mode set to `t' for this to work. 
</example>
